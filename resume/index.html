  <p><strong>Journalist</strong></p>
  <p>I am a multi-platform journalism major at the University of Maryland, going into my junior year. I have experience in news writing, videography and broadcast journalism.</p>

<h2><strong>Experience</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Summer intern</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>The Cape Gazette</strong></h4>
<h5><strong>May 2020 - Present</strong></h5>
<p>I attend newsroom meetings and cover local stories, which requires me to talk to sources and work closely with the editor of the paper. I also take my own photographs for articles and help with the paperâ€™s social media pages. So far this opportunity has taught me to write all kinds of stories, from business, entertainment, news briefs, human interest and more.</p>

<h3>Student reporter</h3>
<h4>The Greenbelt News Review</h4>
<h5>September 2019 - December 2019</h5>
<p>I worked with the editors of the Greenbelt News Review to cover news stories and events in Greenbelt. This taught me a lot about talking to sources and writing for a local newspaper.</p>

<h3>Student caller</h3>
<h4>Tell-A-Terp Call Center</h4>
<h5>August 2019 - November 2019</h5>
<p>I would reach out to alumni and learn more about their experiences at the University of Maryland, as well as help raise funds for the university. This helped me gain customer service and telemarketing skills.</p>
